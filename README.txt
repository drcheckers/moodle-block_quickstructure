README block_quickstructure

Quickstructure is a moodle 2 block that allows course editors to quickly format 
a course with coloured section title strips and thumbnails.
We've found these helpful to give students visual clues of the course structure.

In addition, the strips and thumbnails can be automatically used to form a top level 
menu - an easy and visually appealing method of avoiding the infamous moodle SOD 
('scroll-of-death').

Installation

Installation is complicated by the need to install a moodle form 'widget' 
for a popup colour picker.

** Colour Picker 
The colour picker popup widget

        colourpopup.php 
        colourpopup.js

Install as per any other block - by visiting the admins 'notifications' page

Updated to work with moodle 2.2 - eschewed file picker in favour of simpler - less clicky operation

Emails of gratification to igc@kgv.hk
Limited support available - too many other jobs that pay the mortgage take priority :)
